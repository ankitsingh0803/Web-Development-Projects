		<h2> <font color = "black"> <u> What is baseball analytics? </font> </u> </h2>
		<p> <font color = "601708"> Sabermetrics or baseball analytics is the practice of applying statistical methods to come up with insights on the game of baseball, which might help players at improving their game. Possibly the greatest implementation of this is Statcast, a high speed and high accuracy, automated tool developed to analyze player movements and athletic abilities. It is a network of optical cameras that track vital statistics such as exit velocity and launch angles to gain useful insights. </font>

		<h2> <u> <font color = "black"> Why use Statcast? </font> </u> </h2>
		<font color = "601708"> Each MLB organization now has an analytics team that uses Statcast data to gain a competitive advantage and Stacast has replaced traditional metrics and coaching methodologies. It can also be used to prevent injuries during the season by tracking physical performance metrics. For more information check out this excellent <a href = " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast" target = "_blank" > <u> Wiki page. </u> </a> </font>

		<font color = "601708"> In the following section we discuss how baseball players have suddenly become obsessed with <a href = " http://m.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/launch-angle " target = "_blank" > <u> launch angles </u> </a> and <a href = " http://m.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/exit-velocity " target = "_blank" > <u> exit velocity. </font> </u> </a>

		<h2> <u> <font color = "black"> A tale of angles and velocities </font> </u> </h2>
		<p> <font color = "601708"> The article throws up an interesting point. The number of home runs hit ever since the introduction of Statcast has gone up significantly. Statcast’s data confirms this, where the number went up by 1400 in just two seasons from 2014 to 2016. Analysts have been an able to pinpoint that a range of 25-35 degrees launch angle when coupled with an exit velocity of 95mph or greater has been known to be most effective. Players seem to have taken note of the data provided by Statcast which has led to the rise of the fly-ball trend. The average launch angle in MLB has been rising by an average of 12% every year, from 10.5 degrees in 2015 to 12.8 degrees in 2017. </font> </p>

		The vertical bars in orange represent the all-time high number of homeruns scored in baseball. The first bar represent the year 2000 where major change sin baseball rules where introduced while the seonnd highlights the year 2016, a year after Statcast was introduced.
		</p>

		<p>There’s evidence of the same, where Daniel Murphy in his last season with the Mets had a flyball rate of 36% and a groundball rate of 42.8% but essentially changed his groundball-flyball ratio to 36.3 and 41.9, respectively. This led to him batting with 25 homers, 104 RBI and finishing runner-up in MVP voting. The reason behind the change is evident from his average launch angle that went from 11.1 degrees in 2015 to 16.6 degrees in 2016. Daniel’s teammate Anthony Rendon seems to have followed a similar approach where his launch angle went from 10.6 degrees to 16.8 degrees. It seems like, every batter in baseball today, is now obsessed with finding the right angle and trying to hit the ball higher. </p> </font>

		<h2> <u> <font color = "black"> Why both Statistics are not independent of each other? </font> </u> </h2>
		<img src="velocity_important.png" alt = "importance of velocity" width="500px" height="500px" align = "right">
		<p> <font color = "601708"> Just banking on one statistic, without accounting for the other can be disastrous as shown by the infographic below:
		<div>
		<br>
		The success of a ball struck at a more intermediate angle varies and depends a lot on it’s exit velocity. At any particular launch angle, the number of runs added varies. Low-exit velocities may result in short-hoppers to the infielders, an easy out. As batters hit the balls harder, the expected runs line rises sharply and eventually the balls start sailing over the heads of infielders for singles. Surprisingly, we see a drop in between, as the hits now travel to the outfielders and after a certain point the expected run added rate increases exponentially as balls hit at an exit-velocity more than 95mph become doubles and eventually home runs. </p>

		<p> Chris Taylor, LA Dodgers batter features twice on MLB's list. The table above shows how a difference in 4.2 degrees launch angle made his hit cover a distance of 3 feet more than on the previous hit. </font> </p>

		<h2> <u><font color = "black"> The influence of peers </font> </u> </h2>
		<p> <font color = "601708"> The early success found by Washington Nationals' Daniel Murphy translated into other teammates like Anthony Rendon following suit. It’s not surprising that word of mouth publicity holds such influence as some of the players have been known to trust their teammates whenever taking a potential career changing decision. Player’s often build trust around each other which might not be the case if a manager is hurling random numbers in a bid to improve their game. </p>

		<p> However encouraging all players to change their launch angles can be a disastrous idea. The idea of advocating statistics and numbers to help improve the player’s game is commendable. However, it might often be too confusing to some players and might lead them to think more on the pitch. It is more about getting the players to understand their best swing paths individually. If influenced by their peers, a smaller, less powerful guy might be tempted to increase his launch angle. However, he would be missing out on the role played by exit velocity. That’s where we must proceed with caution. </p>

		You can read more about the influence of peers in this excellent article written at fangraphs.com <a href = " https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/are-early-adopters-of-the-uppercut-influencing-their-clubhouse-peers/ " target = "_blank" > here. </a>

		<p> In the end, it is all about using statistics in a bid to improve player's performance wisely. Data from tools like Statcast, when implemented properly can lead the players and their teams to grow significantly, but, it is not a one-size fits all solution. </font> </p>
